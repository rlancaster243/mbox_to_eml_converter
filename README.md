_Note: All conversions are handled by pure Python libraries, so no system-level dependencies are needed. Conversions such as DOCX‚ÜíPDF or HTML‚ÜíPDF are **not available** on Streamlit Cloud and will display a friendly error if attempted._

## üß© Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- See `requirements.txt` for all needed Python packages

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- **DOCX‚ÜíPDF, HTML‚ÜíPDF, and similar conversions are NOT supported** on Streamlit Cloud or in this app, as they require system-level packages (LibreOffice, WeasyPrint, etc.).
- Some conversions (like PDF‚ÜíDOCX or PDF‚ÜíXLSX) depend on the complexity of the source file‚Äîresults may vary, especially for scanned or poorly-formatted documents.
- **OCR requires Tesseract:** On Streamlit Cloud, Tesseract is available; for local use, you may need to [install Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) separately if running PDF OCR.
